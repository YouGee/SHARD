SHARD stands for "Simple Hit And Run Dungeoncrawler"
The name's tribute to  R.A. Salvatore's book, "The Crystal Shard" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Shard).
SHARD will perhaps be one day a playable duneon crawler like, if I manage to masterize Lua and Love (https://love2d.org) enough :)
Stay tuned.
